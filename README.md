# Supermarket Sales Prediction

## Goal
The goal of this project is to predict supermarket sales using machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle at [Supermarket Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales).

## What I've Done
In this project, I conducted an extensive analysis of the supermarket dataset, encompassing data cleaning, manipulation, preprocessing, and visualization. I then proceeded to build predictive models using various machine learning classification and regression algorithms. Each algorithm's performance was evaluated, including accuracy scores, training scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

In the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, I employed a variety of plots and visualizations to gain insights into the dataset. Some of the visualizations used include histograms, barplots, boxplots, heatmaps and scatter plots.

In the model prediction phase, I obtained different accuracy scores for various models, with the highest accuracy reaching about 52.42 % using the Decision Tree Classifier and random Forest Classifier, which is highly promising for this supermarket dataset. However, it's important to note that other models may benefit from hyperparameter tuning to further improve their accuracy.

## Accuracies of Different Models
-KNeighbors Classifier= 45.45 %
-SVC= 47.57 %
-Logistic Regression = 50.90 %
-Naive Bayes= 51.21 %
-Decision Tree Classifier= 52.42 %
-Random Forest Classifier= 51.51 %
-Gradient Boosting Classifier= 88.26 %
-Bagging Classifier = 53.2 %

We got a good accuracy of about 52.42 % using the Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier which is quite well for the given dataset.


## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project successfully achieved a remarkable accuracy of approximately 53% using the Random Forest Classifier and Random Forest Classifier, demonstrating the potential of these models for the given supermarket sales dataset. For other models, further accuracy improvements can be explored through hyperparameter tuning.
